# React Context API Learning Project

This repository is created to learn and implement React.js  and Context API  concepts. Additionally, a small project called "Book" is being developed to reinforce the learned topics. The Book application aims to manage a book list and includes basic functionalities such as adding and deleting books.

The file and directory structure within the project is as follows:

- `src/components/`: Directory containing the application's components.
- `src/context/`: Directory where the Context API is defined and provided.
- `src/App.js`: Main component that includes the Context provider and uses other components.

The purpose of this project is to learn and apply React Context API by providing a simple project. 

Happy learning!
